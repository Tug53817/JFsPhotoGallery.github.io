I am currently based in Philadelphia, PA, and spend most of my year at Temple University studying economics and English. I have been a photographic hobbyist for about 8 years now. My development as a photographer has mostly come through informal methods such as the internet and simple trial and error, processes that may show in the photographs featured on this site.</p> 
        <p>Regardless, I see photography as a means to capture a particular moment in time and space. Therefore, my photography is more of a method of documentation as apposed to artistic expression. The types of photography I primarily engage in are landscape, wildlife, and street photography, all three of which are conveniently organized into three seperate gallery pages on my site. I have always been fascinated with viewing awsome landscape photography, interesting stills of wildlife, and captivating street photographs. So whenever I am given the opportunity to shoot some pictures myself, I try my best to capture interesting images that will inspire others, just like the photos that inspired me.</p>
        <p>Since I travel extensively, I have been able to capture a variety of diffent landscapes, wildlife, and street photos along the way. I currently rely on Canon and Panasonic camera systems, and also use my iPhone quite often to capture my photographs, though most of my photos featured on this site were taken with a Canon camera system (with a few from my old iPhones as well). Unfortunatley, during the creation of this site, I only had one hard drive available, limiting the number of photographs I could choose from. As a result, this site mostly contains images I took in North America and Europe, while greatly limiting the amount of wildlife photos I have to display. I intend on adding a more diverse set (geographically speaking) of landscape, wildlife, and street photographs to this site as soon as I have access to the rest of my hard drives, which are not currently at school with me. However, please feel free to enjoy the photos I did feature on this site, and if you wish to contact me, or are just curious, check out my professional resume below. </p>
